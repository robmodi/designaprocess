To clean up invalid data in sqlite:
---

delete from equation where process_id not in (select id from processes);
delete from process_notes where process_id not in (select id from processes);

To convert sqlite to mysql:
---

	sqlite3 /var/www/design_your_process/assets/dsp.sqlite .dump | python sqlite3-to-mysql.py -d dyop | grep -v 'grant all on dyop' | mysql

To convert mysql to sqlite:
---

Right now this is a pretty manual process, but basically, I do:

	mysqldump  --skip-create-options --compatible=ansi --skip-extended-insert --compact --single-transaction dyop > /tmp/dyop.sql

	* Then edit /tmp/dyop.sql to set the id of each table as type "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT"
	* Then edit /tmp/dyop.sql to look for \' and replace with ''
	* Then edit /tmp/dyop.sql to look for strings ending in \n' and remove the \n (otherwise, this messes up process_definitions.js.php)
